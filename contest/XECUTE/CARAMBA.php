<p>BKK was playing the ever popular game, Coconut Caramba. In this game, there are N cups numbered 0 to N-1 are kept upside down and one marble. Initially, the Player keeps the marble under the Xth cup. Now, S swaps are done between the cups by the Game organizer without the Playerâ€™s knowledge. In a swap, two cups are selected and swapped. The selection of two cups i and j have a probability of P[i,j] where P is the probability matrix, which is given as input. After S swaps, the Player selects the cup 'Y' and opens it. If that cup contains the marble, then the player wins. Else, he loses. As BKK is a Mathematics teacher, he wants to accurately determine the probability of winning.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of the input consists of t, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains 3 integers, N, X, Y and S denoting the number of cups, the cup under which the marble was initially placed, the cup which is checked for the marble and the number of swaps. The next N lines contain the probability matrix, with each line containing exactly N integers. Each element (i,j) denotes the probability of swapping the cup i and j my the game organizer. The matrix contains integers, which need to be transformed into probability by dividing each element with the sum of that row. Note that X and Y are zero based.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output contains a single number for each test case denoting the probability. The probability must be rounded to 4 decimal places.</p>
