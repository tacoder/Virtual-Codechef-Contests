<p>GUI matters greatly to the user but another major concern is the security of the information. There are a lot of ways to implement security of data. Of these one method is the replacement cipher text generation method. In this each character is replaced by a particular other character and the text is modified. Write a program to display a text box on the screen and every input character given by the user should be displayed as ‘*’ mark. The program should meet the following constraint<br />
The working of enter, backspace should be as usual.<br />
After pressing enter, the password is encrypted using replacement cipher text generating and saved in the file named “pass.txt”.<br />
