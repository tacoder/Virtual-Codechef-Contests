<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Is Bigger Smarter</h1><div class="content">

<p>Some people think that the bigger an elephant is, the smarter it is. To disprove this,<br />
you want to analyze a collection of elephants and place as large a subset of elephants<br />
as possible into a sequence whose weights are increasing but IQâ€™s are decreasing.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input will consist of data for a bunch of elephants, at one elephant per line terminated<br />
by the end-of-file. The data for each particular elephant will consist of a pair of<br />
integers: the first representing its size in kilograms and the second representing its IQ<br />
in hundredths of IQ points. Both integers are between 1 and 10,000. The data contains<br />
information on at most 1,000 elephants. Two elephants may have the same weight, the<br />
same IQ, or even the same weight and IQ.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The only output line should contain an integer n, the length of elephant sequence<br />
found.. If these sequence<br />
of n elephants are a[1], a[2],..., a[n] then it must be the case that weight's of 1,2,3...n must be in strictly increasing order and iq's of 1,2,3,..n must be in strictly decreasing order.<br />
In order for the answer to be correct, n must be as large as possible. All inequalities<br />
are strict: weights must be strictly increasing, and IQs must be strictly decreasing.</p>
