<p>Pranay went to the sea shore and saw what looked like a treasure chest floating. Examining the locking mechanism, he immediately realized he came across a set of puzzles in FreakoMatix-Axis'10 to reward those who are skilled in the mathematical arts and punish those who are not.<br /><br />
There were six dials of the digits 0 through 9 in the puzzle accompanied by a message : "You will be given two positive integers lesser than or equal to a billion. You need to tell the final 6 digits of raising the first to the power of the second".<br /><br /><br />
Pranay was overstruck with grief. With such huge numbers, the multiplications could take ages, but he had no more than a few seconds to give the right answer.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will consist of multiple lines, each containing two integers A and B (1 &lt;= A, B &lt;= 1000000000), separated by a space. A line containing two zeros signals the end of input and should not be processed.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each line of input, print out the correct dial settings, i.e. the final six digits of A^B.</p>
