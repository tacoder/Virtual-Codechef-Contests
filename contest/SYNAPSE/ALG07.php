<p>A house inspector went to evaluate a colony with n houses. And he decided to allocate points to each on basis of his condintion and his neighbours. If the condition of the house is good then it was stated 1 else 0. Thus if both neighbours were in good condition and his condition was also good then he got 3 points, else it was given 2 (if 2 out of the three are good) or 1 based on the condition.<br />
Raj found out the list of points, and he wants to know the condition of his house. He assumes that the first house of the colony is in good condition.<br />
Give the condition of the house, given the point list.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>
