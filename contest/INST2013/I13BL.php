<p>
Once upon a time there were two brothers named RAGHU and RAGHAV. Both are complement of each other.The elder one is RAGHAV.The elder brother RAGHAV does not like his younger brother  because younger one was a more intelligent and successful in comparison to the elder one.Everyone in his house also always praises RAGHU and compare RAGHU's performance with RAGHAV ,and RAGHAV as a result become fun to all.Even his friends after sometime started comparing them ,this made him more frustated and helpless and which make so rough that he don't like to go out anywhere and neither he like to talk to anyone of his colony.Only his Mother knows him and supports him, he knows her son and tried to motivate him to the extent but RAGHAV was unable to come out of that demoralization.This continued till third year of both ,till that time his friends knew him as 'MAGGU'(i.e a bookworm) as he never goes out anywhere neither do he attend any fest of his college ,but he never cared anyone of them.He never tried to tell any of his friend his problem.He only believe his only friend to that is LORD  and no one ,and belives that the LORD knows me and i don't now want anyone to know me.In third year finally he find one friend keshav and he after knowing his problem motivated him to fight again ,the game is still on ..ur brother may be in that college but you can still challenge him by extensively working on it ,and RAGHAV by his words are exteremly motivated and decide to compete with his brother in a coding competition as he is a very good coder.He with Keshav worked extensively on coding for a year and in next year they both with their teams competetd in an event's coding competition.There was 10 questions and RAGHAV on that day was fully prepared to get the challenge and for that he challenged his brother.</p>
<p><br/></br/></p>
<p>
Now during the two hours only he successfully finished 9 problems and was on the top.And in all the 8 problems he himself  thought the logic of each question and Keshav coded it .He didn't take any help from Keshav and from the rest of the group highest till that time was 7.And that was his brother's team.This last problem was just such a problem that he couldn't think the logic of it and so that's why he told Keshav also to involve in that question and so here in this question Keshav role will be played by all who is solving this question.Now assume that you are Keshav and this problem has been given to you and solve it to make RAGHAV win so that in future also he took this confidence and lead his life confidently.</p>

<p>
The question seen by RAGHAV was that you will be given a number N where N .Now question was to find the prime smaller than N and the number of test cases 'T' &lt;=100000.So the inputs and outputs corresponding to that are :</p>
<p>
<b>Input Format</b></p>
<p>It will consist of :</p>
<p>i> First line which tell the <b>number of test cases</b> for which your program will be ran.(t&lt;=100000)</p>
<p>ii> Then 't' lines after that will be the numbers <b>denoting the integer N.</b>N is a positive integer</p>
<p><b>Output Format</b></p>
<p>For each test case, output the result on one line. </p>
<p>Sample Test</p>
<p>
Input:</p>
<p>
3<br />
5</p>
<p>10<br />
17<br />
Output:</p>
<p>
3<br />
7<br />
13</p>
<p>Time limit:1.5sec</p>
<p>Source limit:	50000B</p>
<p>Memory limit:	256MB</p>
