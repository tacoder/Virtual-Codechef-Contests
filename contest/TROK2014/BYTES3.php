<h3>Problem description.</h3>

<p> Design Pro consists of multiple domains like web designing, animations and graphic designing. This event attracts a large number of participants each year where they compete to prove their creative mettle for designing. Here, a participant is required to make a figure of mountain on a hypothetical Photoshop Software. This Photoshop has only two tools in it, one draws “/” and the other draws “\”. You will be given N, number of times each tool is used. You have to output number of figures of mountain possible.<br /><br />
E.g. N=2<br /><br />
Then, the number of figures of mountains possible is 2<br /><br />
/\/\<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  /\<br /><br />
/    \<br />
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of cases to follow.  Each case consists of a number N, the number of time each tool was used.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output consists of T lines, each line has an integer representing the number of figures of mountain possible. The answer has to be printed modulo 1000000007.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>1&lt;=T&lt;=1000<br /><br />
1&lt;=N&lt;=1000000<br /><br />
The sum of all N in an input file will be no more than 3 x 10^8.
