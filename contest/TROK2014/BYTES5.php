<h3>Problem description.</h3>

<p>Bots  is an artificial intelligence programming competition where participants strive<br />
to program games that shall defeat their opponentâ€™s game.  Now you need to play a move to worsen the position of the opponent. You have calculated the value of the N possible moves of the opponent.  You have to calculate the maximum number of moves that has the cumulative value <b> less than K</b>.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of cases to follow.  Each case consists of a number N, the number of total values of move calculated. Next line takes the N integers representing possible values of the moves calculated. Next line consist of Q, numbers of queries. Next line consists of Q integers where each integer represent value of K for a query.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output consists of T lines, each line has Q integers with a space in between, representing number of moves for each query</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>1&lt;=T&lt;=10<br /><br />
1&lt;=N&lt;=100000<br /><br />
1&lt;=Q&lt;=100<br /><br />
1&lt;=K&lt;=10^18<br />
