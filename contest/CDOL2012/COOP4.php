<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Perfect Timing</h1><div class="content">

<p>Girish has recently joined IISc. Being a highly enthusiastic<br />
student he wants to attend as many classes as possible. He has<br />
prepared a list of classes he wants to attend along with their timings.<br />
But he realizes that he can not attend all the classes as some of<br />
their timings clash with each other. Given the schedule of classes,<br />
help Girish identify the maximum number of classes he can attend.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains 'T', the number of test cases (1&lt;=T&lt;=1000). This is followed by 'T' test cases. Each test case consists of a blank line followed by one line containing a number 'C', the number of classes (1&lt;= C &lt;= 1000000). This is followed by 'C' lines, each containing two integers representing the start and end times of each class.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The output should consist of 'T' lines corresponding to the 'T' test cases. Each line should contain one number, which is the maximum number of classes that can be attended.</p>
