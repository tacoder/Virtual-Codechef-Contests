So their professor decided to make them play a game in order to motivate them<br />
towards their academics.So the professor called two sets(equal number) of<br />
same height (heights in one set are repeated in other set).<br />He asked one<br />
set of students to stand randomly and the other set to stand in the ascending<br />
order of their heights opposite to each other.Professor asked students of<br />
same height to exchange their positions.The motto of the game is to write a<br />
program to calculate how many times the students of both sets meet.</font></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contain N,number of students<br /><br />
Next line contains heights of those N students arranged in random order.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p> Number of inversions are X.<br /><br />
Here, X is the required answer</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>No two persons in a set should not have same height</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><b>Input:<br /></b><br />
