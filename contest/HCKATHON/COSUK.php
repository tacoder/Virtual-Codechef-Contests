<p>Abhay is a software developer at some company the company makes him work day in and day out, making him sit for hours in front of the computer coding. Hours of coding have become a cause of abhays severe headache and he desperately needs a break now so he thinks of organizing a party at his place. Interestingly abhay has invited equal number of men and women (who are his colleagues) to the party and wants to start the party with a group photograph abhay is also a keen mathematician and wants to know a special number called COSUK which is the sum of the digits of the number of arrangements of n men and n women. Being intoxicated in the bash he asks you to implement a calculator that calculates this special number.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input to the problem is a number T the number of test cases and then T test cases follow with a number n on each subsequent line indicating the number of men and women invited to the party. (T&lt;=10000 &amp; 0&lt;=n&lt;=200)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output the number COSUK.<br />
COSUK = sum of digits of the number indicating the number of arrangements of the n men and n woman.<br />
Output your answer mod 100000007 (mod means %).</p>
