<p>In India every state is flooded with engg. colleges. So, state government's have decided to change their state's name according to the number of colleges in their </p>
<p>state. Some one has developed a software which guess first letter for their states name when fed with input as total number of engg. colleges in that state. </p>
<p>Maximum number of colleges can be 9999999999 in any state and minimum is 1. If a state has no engg. college then software terminates and doesn't output any </p>
<p>further result. But the person who developed the software has forgot the logic he applied in that code. You need to guess the logic so that further </p>
<p>development can take place.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each line of input consists of a number of colleges (maximum 10 digits) to be tested. when 0 is encountered as input program terminates</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Ouput consists of an alphabet for each input number.</p>
