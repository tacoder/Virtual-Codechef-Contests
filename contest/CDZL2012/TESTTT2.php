<p>You are responsible for conducting a fest in your college. Each student has told his choice for pop night, which he/ she wants  and one he/she doesnâ€™t want; of course they all understand that since there is only going to be one singer, no one is likely to have all their requirements satisfied. Can you call a singer that will satisfy at least one request from all your friends?<br />
 <br />
Input Code	Teacher <br />
A. 	Honey Singh<br />
B. 	Atif Aslam<br />
C. 	Mika<br />
D. 	Annu Malik<br />
E. 	Shreya Ghoshal<br />
F. 	Mohit chauhan<br />
G. 	Daler mehndi<br />
H. 	Moulvi<br />
I. 	Saleem<br />
J. 	Sonu Nigam<br />
K. 	Abheejet Sawant<br />
L. 	Sudesh Bhosle<br />
M.	Bryan Adams<br />
N. 	Khelash Kher<br />
O. 	Alisha<br />
P. 	Shakira</p>
<p>Your friends provide you with a line of text that describes their preferences. For example, the line<br />
+O-H+P;<br />
reveals that someone will accept xyz, Iyer but not abc<br />
-E-I-D+A+J;<br />
indicates that someone else will not accept Shreya, Saleem and Annu, but Honey Singh or Sonu Nigam would be accepted</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The input consists of a series of constraints.<br />
A constraint is a list of 1 to 12 students choice lists.Each on a line by itself followed by a period on a line by itself.<br />
A constraint list is a series of singers requests terminated by a single semicolon.<br />
A request is a sign character (+/-) and then an uppercase letter from A to P. </p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each constraint, provide a description of a singers that satisfies it. A description is the string "Singers: " in columns 1 through 10 and then a series of letters, in alphabetical order, listing the codes for singers possible. So, for listing possible singers as Shreya, Saleem and Annu, you  need to print:<br />
Singers: EID<br />
If no combination of singers can be found which satisfies at least one request of every person, your program should print the string<br />
"Sorry" on a line by itself starting in column 1. </p>
