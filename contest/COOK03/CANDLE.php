<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Birthday Candles</h1><div class="content">

<p>The chef is preparing a birthday cake for one of his guests,<br />
and his decided to write the age of the guest in candles on the cake.<br />
There are 10 types of candles, one for each of the digits '0' through '9'.<br />
The chef has forgotten the age of the guest, however, so doesn't know whether he has enough candles of the right types.<br />
For example, if the guest were 101 years old, the chef would need two '1' candles and one '0' candle.<br />
Given the candles the chef has, your task is to determine the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented with those candles.</p>
<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>Input will begin with an integer Tâ‰¤100, the number of test cases.<br />
Each test case consists of a single line with exactly 10 integers, each between 0 and 8, inclusive.<br />
The first integer of each test case represents the number of '0' candles the chef has,<br />
the second integer represents the number of '1' candles the chef has, and so on.</p>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a single line the smallest positive integer that cannot be expressed with the given candles.</p>
