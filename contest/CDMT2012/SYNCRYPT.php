<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Synapse Crypt Secrets</h1><div class="content">

<p>In the carnival of Synapse there are very important messages  that need to be passed between the various clowns. These messages are very important as they contain the acts which they are going to perform so they encode it using Synoquote a techniquie the devised  so no rival carnival can read them.<br />
A Synoquote is a simple encoded message where one letter is simply replaced by another<br />
throughout the message.<br /> For example:<br />
Encoded: FDY GAI BG UKMY<br />
Decoded: THE SKY IS BLUE</p>
<p>But being clowns they are very confused on how to decode these messages so kindly help them.<br />
<br/></br/></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer N, (0 &lt; N &lt;1001) which is the number of test cases  that<br />
follow. Each testcase consists of two lines of input. The first line is the encoded message. The<br />
second line is a 26 character string of upper case letters giving the character mapping for each letter<br />
of the alphabet: the first character gives the mapping for A, the second for B and so on. Only upper<br />
case letters will be used. Spaces may appear in the encoded message, and should be preserved in<br />
the output string.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each testcase, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The data set<br />
number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space and the decoded message.</p>
