<p>In a war of Wasseypur, Faizal Khan was desperate to kill Sultan. He already knew Sultan was going to attack him.</p>
<p>
Sultan has to meet an important person in Kabal Bagh. Since Faizal Khan somehow, is aware of Sultan's meeting, he has planted master-bombs in the park. Sultan, somehow, had the premonition of Faizal's plan.<br />
He took along with him bomb diffuser. </p>
<p>But each Master bomb is surrounded by either wall or bombs on each side (north,east,west,south).<br />
As soon as Sultan reaches the garden he notes down the coordinates of the bombs that have been planted.<br />
Now he has to count the Master bombs that have been placed on the area.</p>
<p>
Given position of all the bombs help Sultan to count the number of Master Bombs so that he can diffuse them.
