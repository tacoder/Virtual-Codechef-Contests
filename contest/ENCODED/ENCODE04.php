<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Developer or Tester</h1><div class="content">

<p>It is high time now, IT companies are hiring in huge numbers.<br />
Now that they have hired they need to form teams each containing exactly 2 members.<br />
No two members in the team have the same age.<br />
In any team, older is given the position of a Developer (D) and younger is given the position of a Tester (T).<br />
They have sorted all the members to form a list according to their ages (such that youngest in the list is the first).<br />
However even before forming teams they have assigned designations (D or T) to all the members in the list.<br />
Now it is your duty to tell whether it is still possible to form teams with the requirements stated above and<br />
also maintain the assigned designation of each of the persons.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>1st line: An Integer T denoting the number of test cases<br />
