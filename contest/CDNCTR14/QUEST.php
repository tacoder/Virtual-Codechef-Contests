<p> </p>
<p>Smaug, the dragon, rules under The Mountain, Erabor which was originally the ruling place of Dwarf King. King Thorin, who is the rightful heir to the throne is on his way to take back his kingdom from Smaug. With the help of a map, King Thorin is able to find a secret entry into the mountain. But now when he has reached the door, he finds that the door has been sealed and can only be unlocked using a special key.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The key to unlock the door is a palindrome which is an anagram of a given word.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The king has a list of words. For each given word, can you help the king in figuring out if any anagram of it can be a palindrome or not?.
