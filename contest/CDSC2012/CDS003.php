<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Nonsense with ASCII</h1><div class="content">

<p>At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format.</p>
