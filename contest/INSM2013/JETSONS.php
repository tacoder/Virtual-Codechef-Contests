Now since not all people can afford houses that high. most people have houses at lower levels and others at higher level.yeah there are divides even then<br />
:(.</p>
<p>So the then government decided to find the inconvience caused due to high houses obstacling the traffic light.Now your task is to find the shadow of the house.Well that didn't sound so good ok you have to find the area of the shadow.</p>
<p>Now if the shadow area is infinite print -1 or if shadow is a line print 0 as its area.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>T number of test cases.<br />
for each test cases first two lines each contain the x, y and z coordinates of the diagonal of the house.<br />
