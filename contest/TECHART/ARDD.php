<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Darshits Dilemma</h1><div class="content">

<p>Darshit enters his classroom to discover his Professor Shastri shouting at the top of his voice, and the entire class in commotion. He soon realizes what's wrong.  Someone broke a canister of Deodorant in the class, and Prof. Shastri will do anything to break his bones. </p>
<p>Since no one knows who really did it, and it was probably done by someone from outside the class, the students decide to play a game. The loser of that game would have to own up to Prof. Shastri.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be a problem if Darshit wasn't on the defaulters list. But he was, and under no circumstances could own up to this messy situation. </p>
<p>Help Darshit figure out exactly which person would be the loser in this game.</p>
<h3> The game </h3>
<p>All the students would sit on their seats, and their names would be written in a list. Then, one by one, names would be struck off the list. A number between 1 and 5 would be chosen, and the striking would proceed based on that number. The second last person to be struck off the list would have to own up to Prof. Shastri</p>
<p>This would've been easy if people still had to sit, but most of the class had already picked their seats!<br />
</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>There will be total 5 sample inputs given to your program. All input values lie between 0 and 120.<br />
</p>
<h3>Sample </h3>
<p>Assuming a class of 7 students<br />
And a random number 3, striking would proceed as follows:<br />
3,6,2,7,5,1,4 </p>
<p>Thus, the first person in the original list of names would be the loser.</p>
<h3>Example Input</h3>
<p> (Number of namesXRandom Number)</p>
<p>
7X3<br />
5X4<br />
6X5<br />
9X2<br />
3X5</p>
<h3>Example Output</h3>
<p>1<br />
2<br />
4<br />
7<br />
3</p>
