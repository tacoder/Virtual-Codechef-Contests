<?php require("../../includes/header.php"); ?><h1>Martian Coin Game</h1><div class="content">

<p><i>Freakin' news has recently claimed that they have discovered a civilization on mars and that they have established contact with the martians. Following is a summary of the midnight hour breakin' news on freakin' news :</i></p>
<p><b>Playful Configuration</b> <br />
A configuration of n coins placed in a 2 Ã— n grid (2 rows, n columns) such that every column contains exactly one coin is called a playful configuration.<br />
(Coins can only be placed inside a cell, and not on the boundary of two cells. Every coin is facing either heads-up or tails-up.)</p>
<p><b>One can update a playful configuration in the following ways :</b><br />
1) <b> switch(i, j) </b>, where 1&lt;=i&lt;=j&lt;=n :<br />
For all integers r such that i&lt;=r&lt;=j, do the following :<br />
If there is a coin at (1, r), remove it and place it, facing same side up at (2, r).<br />
Otherwise remove the coin at (2, r) and place it, facing same side up at (1, r).<br />
2) <b> flip(i, j) </b>, where 1&lt;=i&lt;=j&lt;=n :<br />
For all integers r such that i&lt;=r&lt;=j, do the following :<br />
Flip the coin in column r without changing its position. (If the coin is initially facing heads-up then after flipping it will face tails-up and vice versa.) </p>
<p><b>One can query a playful configuration in the following way :</b><br />
<b>query(i, j)</b> , where 1&lt;=i&lt;=j&lt;=n :<br />
Let h1 be the number of integers r such that i&lt;=r&lt;=j and there is a coin facing heads-up at (1,r).<br />
Let h2 be the number of integers r such that i&lt;=r&lt;=j and there is a coin facing heads-up at (2,r).<br />
Let t1 be the number of integers r such that i&lt;=r&lt;=j and there is a coin facing tails-up at (1,r).<br />
Let t2 be the number of integers r such that i&lt;=r&lt;=j and there is a coin facing tails-up at (2,r).<br />
query(i, j) returns h1,h2,t1 and t2.</p>
<p><b>The king of mars plays the following game every month :</b><br />
He arranges n coins in a playful configuration. Initially all coins are in the first row (facing either heads-up or tails-up). He periodically performs operations on the configurations. Each operation is either an update (flip or switch) or a query. Any player who responds correctly to each query wins a large prize. Unfortunately, the game is too difficult and no player has yet won the coveted prize.  </p>
<p>This month however, one of the ministers has gained access to the initial configuration as well as a list of all the operations. The minister has asked freakin' news to help him answer all queries correctly. <i>Your job is to do this task for freakin' news.</i></p>
<h3>Input Format </h3>

<p>The first line contains a single integer n : The number of coins in the playful configuration. </p>
<p>The next line contains n space seperated integers f[1],f[2],...f[n] which describe the inital state of the coins. The coin in column i is initially at (1,i). If f[i] is 1, the coin at (1,i) is initially facing heads-up. Otherwise, the coin at (1,i) is initially facing tails-up.</p>
<p>The next line contains a single integer m : The number of operations. </p>
<p>The k'th of the next m lines contains 3 integers op,i,j which describe the k'th operation. Each operation is described as follows :<br />
If op is 0, the operation is query(i,j).<br />
If op is 1, the operation is flip(i,j).<br />
If op is 2, the operation is switch(i,j).</p>
<h3>Output Format </h3>
<p>For each query, the program must output a single line consisting of 4 space seperated integers h1, h2, t1 and t2.</p>
<h3>Constraints </h3>
<p>1&lt;=n&lt;=100000<br />
Each f[i] is either 0 or 1.<br />
1&lt;=m&lt;=100000<br />
For each operation, op is either 0,1 or 2.<br />
For each operation, 1&lt;=i&lt;=j&lt;=n.</p>
<h3>Sample Input </h3>
<p>10<br />
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0<br />
5<br />
0 1 7<br />
2 3 5<br />

<h3>Sample Output </h3>
<p>5 0 2 0<br />
2 3 2 0<br />
2 0 2 3</p>
<h3>Explanation </h3>

<p>At the time of the first query, the configuration is :<br />
H H H H H T T T T T<br />
E E E E E E E E E E</p>
<p>At the time of the second query the configuration is :<br />
H H E E E T T T T T<br />
E E H H H E E E E E</p>
<p>At the time of the third query the configuration is :<br />
T T E E E H H H H H<br />
E E T T T E E E E E</p>
