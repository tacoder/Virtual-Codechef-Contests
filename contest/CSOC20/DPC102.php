            <span lang="RU">Ali knows how to count, but he is now learning how to<br />
            write numbers. As he is a very good student, he already learned 1, 2, 3 and 4.<br />
            But he did not realize yet that 4 is different from 1, so he thinks that 4 is<br />
            another way to write 1. Besides that, he is having fun with a little game he<br />
            created himself: he make numbers (with those four digits) and sum their values.<br />
            For instance:</span><span lang="RU"> </span>
        </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
            <span lang="RU">132 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6</span><span lang="RU"> </span>
        </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
            <span lang="RU">112314 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9</span><span lang="RU"> </span>
        </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
            <span lang="RU">(Remember that Ali thinks that 4 = 1)</span><span lang="RU"> </span>

<p class="MsoNormal">
            <span lang="RU">After making a lot of numbers in this way, Ali now<br />
            wants to know how much numbers he can create such that their sum is a number n.<br />
            For instance, for n=2 he noticed that he can make 5 numbers: 11, 14, 41, 44 and<br />
            2 (he knows how to count them up, but he does not know how to write five).<br />
            However, he cannot figure it out for n greater that 2. So, he asked you to help<br />
            him.</span><span lang="RU"> </span>
