<p>Assume that we are in year 2020, in which ISRO is sending human to space for 20th time. During the last few missions scientists found that human language can be<br />
related to the aliens language. In general the human language is born from sounds, but for a particular human sound there will be a specified unwanted string to be<br />
removed from the human language in order to communicate with aliens. Now, we want you to help the astronauts by removing the unwanted string from the particular<br />
human sound(string) and displaying the remaining alphabets in alphabetical order with each remaining alphabet followed by number of times it appears in the human<br />
string.</p>
<p>NOTE:<br />
 Human string or unwanted string doesn't contain any spaces between them.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input consists of two strings (strlen&lt;1000) seperated by a space between them.<br />
One corresponds to human string and other the unwanted string.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output contains the remaining alphabets in alphabetical order with each remaining alphabet followed by the number of times it appears in the human string.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
abcdefghijk abcd

<b>Output:</b>
