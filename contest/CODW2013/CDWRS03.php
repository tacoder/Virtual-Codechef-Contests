<p>DaenerysTargaryen is all set to mount on her dragon and fly over to King’s Landing and take over the iron throne. On her way , she encounters many towers. Since she has just started learning to ride her dragon , she doesn’t know how to descend , but knows how to only ascend and move sideways . Given this, she wants to go through as many tower tops to set them on fire before she reaches kings landing . Help her find the maximum number of towers she can set fire.</p>
<p>[ Note: She can avoid a tower by going around it . ]</p>
<h3>Input :</h3>
<p>The first line of input is the total number of towers , and the next ‘n’ lines contain an integer , the height of the ‘ith’ tower .</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print the maximum number of towers that DaenerysTargaryen can set fire.</p>
<h3>Contraints</h3>
<p>n&lt;=10^6</p>
<p>Height of each tower &lt;=10^4</p>
<h3>Sample input 1:</h3>
<p>5<br /><br />
1 6 4 5 2</p>
<h3>Sample Output 1:</h3>
<p>3<br /></p>
<p>In the above test case, DaenerysTargareyn will fly to the 1st , 3rd and 4th tower by ascending and thus covering the maximum number of towers.</p>    </div><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left">
